### **This project is dedicated to customer segmentation of an online gift shop using various clustering methods.**

The work was carried out as an educational task based on real data from a company engaged in online retail, which was located in the United Kingdom during the period from 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011.

**The data is presented as a .csv file, where each row contains information about a unique transaction.**
